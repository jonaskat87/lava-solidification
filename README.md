# lava-solidification
This repository contains various codes, figures, and other files relevant for "Some lava flows may not have been as thick as they appear" by Katona et al. (in preparation). For now, if you would like more information on how each file (data, script, etc.) is used, please email either Jonas at jonas.katona@yale.edu or Ruby at rubyfu@caltech.edu.
