# lava-solidification
This repository contains various scripts, figures, and other files relevant for "Some lava flows may not have been as thick as they appear" by Katona et al. (in preparation). For now, if you would like more information on how these scripts work, and what each script is used for, please email either Jonas at jonas.katona@yale.edu or Ruby at rubyfu@caltech.edu.

**NOTE:** For all scripts in this repository, the path names will have to be adjusted according to how you have organized your files, but all of the files you need should be here.
